Practice C with sorting algorithms.
 I am taking Operating System this Fall (2014 Fall) as a master student. So, this is the way to review C language. I choose an Algorithms book and implement most sorting algorithms in both array and linked list. Also, create a file to read for testing the sorting algorithms. The file includes a list of number and description. The output of the sorting should be ordered by the number. I use makefile and bash script in individual sorting folder to make it easier to test and demo.

Thanks!
